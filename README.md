### Cookbook
A place to track your favorite recipes and remind you to do some kitchen innovation, keeping a mindful, healthy diet.

### Deploy

To use Cookbook App, download a zip file from Github ().

After unzipping and saving the contents to your desired directory, run `bundle install` in your terminal to install all the gems required for this program.

From within your directory, run `rackup config.ru` in the terminal. Then open localhost:9292 in a web browser. This program will run.

To quit the program exit your web browser and type "ctrl + c" in your terminal to exit your local server.

Or if you wish, just click [here](https://cookbook-db-sinatra.herokuapp.com/).

Please, wait a little minute for the page to load. I am using a free hosting service and it can be a little slow the first time you open the page.

Thank you for your patience and your time. ðŸ™ƒ
